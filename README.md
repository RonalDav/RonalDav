#### 🚧 Under Construction 🚧
This page is currently under construction and will be updated.

## 🌟 Key Highlights 
  
- **Academic Research**: Contributions to research initiatives and ongoing academic work.
  
- **Academic Projects**: Homework assignments and projects that I enjoyed are slowly being added, though, not all may be publicly listed.

- **Previous Work**: A few of my older pieces of work from previous roles/internships have been added here that are not whole, but those are meant to be representative of past projects.
  
- **Personal Projects**: You may find a few scripts or snippets or even entire projects that I made for or with friends and wish to share!


## 📁 Project Migration
I am in the process of migrating projects to this account and making them public. Please note that not all projects or tools can be shared in their entirety due to sensitivity and confidentiality concerns.



**Note:** While some projects may not be fully visible here, I aim to provide a thorough overview of my work. If you would like to discuss any specific projects in more detail, feel free to reach out.
