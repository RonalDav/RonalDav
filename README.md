### **Under Construction**
This page is currently under construction and will be updated.

### **Key Highlights**

- **Academic Research:** Contributions to research initiatives and ongoing academic work.

- **Academic Projects:** Homework assignments and projects that I enjoyed are gradually being added, although not all may be publicly listed.

- **Previous Work:** A few of my older pieces of work from previous roles or internships have been added here that are not complete, but those are intended to be representative of past projects.

- **Personal Projects:** You may find a few scripts, snippets, or even entire projects that I made for or with friends and wish to share!

### **Project Migration**
I am in the process of migrating projects to this account and making them public. Please note that not all projects or tools can be shared in their entirety due to sensitivity and confidentiality concerns.

**Note:** While some projects may not be fully visible here, I intend to provide a comprehensive overview of my work. If you would like to discuss any specific projects in greater detail, please do not hesitate to contact me.
