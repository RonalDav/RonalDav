# **Ronald Davies - PhD Student in Computer Science & Engineering**

Welcome to my GitHub! I am a PhD student having fun with audio science, bioinformatics, immunomics, exploration, and artificial intelligence. Here, you’ll find a mix of my academic and personal projects, and occasionally some of my ongoing research will be visible as well. 

I have a few local LLM server setups coming soon for generically reproducing any LLM based implementation without the need for public API usage. The motivation for this is my personal desire to stay a step ahead of privacy risks imposed by the collection of information shared with companies that operate LLMs via API services. I hope others can find value in this as well!

### **Where is Everything?**
I am currently in the process of migrating and making some of my previous projects public. Due to privacy and confidentiality constraints, not all projects or code can be shared in full.

**Want to know more?** If any project sparks your interest or if you'd like to dive deeper into specific areas of my work, feel free to reach out. I’d love to connect and discuss further!
